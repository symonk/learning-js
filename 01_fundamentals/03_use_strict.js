/* In order to be using modern ES5+ features, the use of use strict
can enable more modern features of the javascript language at 
breaking older backwards compatibility.  use strict can be placed
on a per function basis, however often it is best used at the
top of the file like below to have full compatibility throughout.

use strict is also implicit, when dealing with things like modern classes
and objects etc.*/

// ... any code before the declaration would not have strict applied.

"use strict";
